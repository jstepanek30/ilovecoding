My next job was in international company named Foxconn as IT Helpdesk, my job was to provide a neccesary help to end users with they common problems. After few years I move inside the company to the Network Administrators team and learn some inmportant things in computer networking, but the salary of this job was too low so i decided to change my job to some wierd job for a IT guy. I started next job in the power plant as machine operator and learn some useful skills like how the electricity is made and some stuff around physics. </p>
